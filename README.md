Project: Recipes - The Odin Project
This is my first real project within The Odin Project's curriculum. 
The website will consist of a main index page, which will have links to a few recipes.
This project will initially convey basic HTML knowledge obtained thus far, and will be added onto at a later time to introduce CSS styling.
