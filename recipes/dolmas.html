    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Dolmas, or stuffed grape leaves, are staple dishes of the eastern Mediterranean. They are commonly stuffed with a lemon-flavored mixture of rice, onion, and ground lamb. They can be eaten cold or warm. Meat-filled dolmas are traditionally eaten warm, and rice-filled dolmas are best served cold with lemon juice and olive oil. Rolling dolmas can be very tricky, so don't get discouraged. Also, lining the pan when cooking dolmas is necessary to keep your grape leaves from burning.</p>
