    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <p>For the baklava and nut filling:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>6 oz shelled pistachios, chopped</li>
        <li>6 oz walnuts, chopped</li>
        <li>6 oz hazelnuts, chopped</li>
        <li>1/4 cup sugar</li>
        <li>1 to 2 Tbsp ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>large pinch of ground cloves</li>
        <li>16 oz package phyllo dough, thawed</li>
        <li>1 1/2 to 2 sticks of unsalted butter, melted</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For the honey syrup:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>3/4 cup sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup cold water</li>
        <li>1 cup honey</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp orange extract</li>
        <li>5 whole cloves</li>
        <li> 1 lemon, squeezed and juiced</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F</li>
        <li> Make the honey syrup: Place the sugar and water in a saucepan and heat stove-top, stirring occaisonally, until the sugar dissolves. Add the honey, orange extract, and whole cloves, and stir to mix. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer for about 25 minutes. Remove the syrup from heat and let cool to lukewarm. Add lemon juice. Remove the whole cloves.</li>
        <li>Make the nut mixture: In a food processor bowl, add pistachios, walnuts, and hazelnuts. Pulse a few times to chop. Transfer to a large mixing bowl and add sugar, cinnamon, and ground cloves. Mix well to combine.</li>
        <li>Prepare the phyllo pastry: Unroll the thawed phyllo pastry and place the sheets in between two clean kitchen towels. This will help keep the phyllo from breaking while you work.</li>
        <li>Assemble the baklava: Prepare a 9" x 13" x 2" baking pan. Brush the interior of the pan with some of the melted butter. To assemble the baklava, take one sheet of phyllo and place it in the pan. Brush the top of the phyllo sheet with the melted butter. Repeat this process a few more times until you have used up about 1/3 of the phyllo pastry, each layer being brushed with the melted butter. Distribute about 1/2 of the nut mixture evenly over the top layer pf phyllo. Continue assembling the baklava, one sheet of phyllo pastry at a time using another 1/3 of the phylo. Again, brush each layer with a bit of the melted butter. Distribute the remaining 1/2 of the nut mixture evenly over the top layer of the phyllo. Finish the remaining 1/3 of the phyllo pastry following the same process, laying one folded sheet at a time and brushing each layer with melted butter. Brush the very top sheet of phyllo with butter.</li>
        <li>Cut the baklava pastry into pieces: using a sharp knife, cut the pastry into 24 diamond shaped pieces.</li>
        <li>Bake: Place the baking dish on the middle rack of your heated oven. Bake between 35 and 45 minutes or until the top of the baklava turns golden and a skewer inserted in the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li>Pour syrup over hot baklava as soon as you remove it from the oven.</li>
        <li>Cool for at least 1 hour. Cut through the earlier marked pieces and serve with a garnish of chopped pistachios.</li>
    </ol>
