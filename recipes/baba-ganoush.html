    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>Baba ganoush, also known as baba ganouj, muttabal, or salat hatzilim, is a creamy eggplant dip made by mixing tender roasted eggplant and nutty tahini with garlic, citrus, and spices. Grilling the eggplant over an open flame will give more flavor, and allowing the dip to chill in the fridge will cause it to thicken and the flavors will meld together.</p>
    <p>This recipe has a prep time of 15 minutes, a cook time of 20 minutes, and a draining and resting time of 1 hour. The approximate total time for this recipe is 1 hour and 35 minutes. The recipe will easily serve 6 or more people. It is best served with pita bread, pita chips, or cut veggies.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 eggplants</li>
        <li>1/4 cup tahini paste</li>
        <li>1 lemon, squeezed and juiced</li>
        <li>1 garlic clove, minced</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp plain Greek yogurt</li>
        <li>Kosher salt and black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tsp sumac</li>
        <li>3/4 tsp Aleppo pepper or red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>toasted pine nuts, for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Smoke or grill the eggplant on medium-high. Place the eggplant directly over the flame. Using the tongs, turn the eggplant every 5 minutes until it is tender and the skin is charred (approximately 20 minutes).</li>
        <li>Transfer the eggplant to a large colander over a bowl. Allow it to sit and drain until fully cooled and all excess water has been drained. Making a slit in the eggplant can help to release its juices.</li>
        <li>Once the eggplant is cool enough to hold, peel the charred skin off. Discard the skin and the stem.</li>
        <li>Transfer the eggplant to a bowl. Using a fork, break down into smaller pieces.</li>
        <li>Add the tahini paste, garlic, lemon juice, Greek yogurt, salt, pepper, sumac, and the Aleppo pepper or crushed red pepper flakes to the bowl. Mix well by fork.</li>
        <li>Cover the baba ganoush and chill in the fridge from 30 minutes to an hour.</li>
        <li>To serve, transfer the baba ganoush to a serving dish or bowl. Top with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and toasted pine nuts. It is best served with pita or veggies of your choice.</li>
    </ol>
